You're live! Nice. We've put together a littl**e post to introduce you to the** Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `crosshair/ghost`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!

## Getting Started

Ghost uses something called Markdown for writ**ing. Essentially, it's a short**hand way to manage your post formatting as you write!

Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the le**ft hand panel of Ghost, you si**mply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:

* Item number one. This item is a whole lot l**onger than [expected](#test). **In fact it is a paragraph on its own. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam,quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
* Item number two
    * A nested item
* A final item

or with numbers!

1. Remember to buy some milk
    1. test
    2. test
2. Drink the milk
3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it

### Links

Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.

### What about Images?

Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:

![Awesomeness](../assets/images/cover.jpg "title")

Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:

![A bowl of bananas]


### Quoting

Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!

### Working with Code

Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.

    .awesome-thing {
        display: block;
        width: 100%;
    }

### Ready for a Break? 

Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.

### Advanced Usage

There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.

<input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!" />

That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)
